This blog contains articles about different technologies in software engineering. Here I share my experience an my views on the technologies I worked with or had an opprotunity to explore. Please enjoy reading it and if any of the information written here becomes helpful to you, this effort was definitelly worth it.

[<h3>GoLang Testing</h3>]()

It is needless to say how important the unit testing is in early detection of potential problems with our code. And GoLang team seeing value in unit tests provides nice infrastructure for writing unit tests out of the box with GoLang SDK. The capabilities are extensive and go way beyond just validating the results in a traditional unit test application where we run a unit test, then compare the results with expected values and either stop or go to the next test. Here, I will try to talk about some of them that I find quite useful.
